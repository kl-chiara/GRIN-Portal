# GRIN Portal

Welcome to the official Github repository of the **GRIN Portal** (https://grin-portal.broadinstitute.org/).

The GRIN Portal is a coalition of investigators seeking to aggregate and harmonize data generated to study GRIN-related disorders, and to make summary data interactively accessible for the wider scientific community, while providing educational resources for everyone.

The goals of this project are:

- Providing information on GRIN-related disorders
- Supporting research on GRIN-related disorders
- Facilitating recruitment of individuals to the global GRIN registry
- Providing support in variant interpretation and classification
- Visualizing data from the global GRIN registry
- Linking researchers, clinicians and families

## Project overview
Currently, interpreting genetic testing results of individuals carrying pathogenic variants in *GRIN1, GRIN2A, GRIN2B* and *GRIN2D* remains challenging and predicting the clinical outcome is difficult.
The GRIN Portal serves as a novel resource for the community to facilitate education, variant interpretation & research on GRIN genes and associated disorders. The framework is designed to connect various types of data at massive scale.

## Functionalities
- The tab “Basic Information” of the GRIN Portal provides an overview of the history and current state of GRIN-research, as well as clinical and genetic summaries from the GRIN registry of almost 600 participants.
- The “Families” tab provides educational videos on GRIN genes and links to family organizations from all over the world.
- The “Variant Analysis” tab provides tools to inform the user about GRIN-variants with genetic information, patient information from the GRIN Registry, and comparisons to molecular, clinical and genetic data stored within the GRIN Portal.  The user may also download a report of the selected variant or assess multiple variants at the same time. 
- Under the “Research” tab, all molecular, genetic and clinical data is integrated and can be interactively explored through filtering and mapping on 2D protein sequences and 3D protein structures. Group level summary statistics on clinical and functional information are also available.
